    # RFC 6891. Number of bytes size to advertise as the EDNS reassembly buffer
    # size. This is the value put into datagrams over UDP towards peers.
    # 4096 is RFC recommended. 1472 has a reasonable chance to fit within a
    # single Ethernet frame, thus lessing the chance of fragmentation
    # reassembly problems (usually seen as timeouts). Setting to 512 bypasses
    # even the most stringent path MTU problems, but is not recommended since
    # the amount of TCP fallback generated is excessive.

    # RFC 8198. Use the DNSSEC NSEC chain to synthesize NXDO-MAIN and other
    # denials, using information from previous NXDO-MAINs answers. In other
    # words, use cached NSEC records to generate negative answers within a
    # range and positive answers from wildcards. This increases performance,
    # decreases latency and resource utilization on both authoritative and
    # recursive servers, and increases privacy. Also, it may help increase
    # resilience to certain DoS attacks in some circumstances.
    aggressive-nsec: yes

    # Extra delay for timeouted UDP ports before they are closed, in msec.
    # This prevents very delayed answer packets from the upstream (recursive)
    # servers from bouncing against closed ports and setting off all sort of
    # close-port counters, with eg. 1500 msec. When timeouts happen you need
    # extra sockets, it checks the ID and remote IP of packets, and unwanted
    # packets are added to the unwanted packet counter.

    # File with trust anchor for one zone, which is tracked with RFC 5011 probes. 
    # The probes are run several times per month, thus the machine must be online frequently. 
    # The initial file can be one with contents as described in trust-anchor-file. 
    # The file is written to when the anchor is updated, so the Unbound user must have write permission. 
    # Write permission to the file, but also to the directory it is in (to create a temporary file, 
    # which is necessary to deal with filesystem full events), it must also be inside the chroot (if that is used).

    # Harden against algorithm downgrade when multiple algorithms are advertised in the
    # DS record. This works by first choosing only the strongest DS digest type as per
    # RFC 4509 (Unbound treats the highest algorithm as the strongest) and then expecting 
    # signatures from all the advertised signing algorithms from the chosen DS(es) to 
    # be present. If no, allows any one supported algorithm to validate the zone,
    # even if other advertised algorithms are broken. RFC 6840 mandates that zone signers 
    # must produce zones signed with all advertised algorithms, but sometimes they do not.
    # RFC 6840 also clarifies that this requirement is not for validators and validators
    # should accept any single valid path. It should thus be explicitly noted that this
    # option violates RFC 6840 for DNSSEC validation and should only be used to perform
    # a signature completeness test to support troubleshooting.
